## Project description

A calendar that displays and prioritizes events created by the user. Maybe we can use the Google Calendar API if we have time?

## Credits

Preliminary skeleton based on the [Lab 2 Git repo for COGS 120](https://github.com/intro-hci-ucsd/lab2) originally created by Scott Klemmer, Michael Bernstein, and a coalition of TAs. That version, in turn, was modified by Sean Kross from [a forked version](https://github.com/pgbovine/lab2) which incorporates changes from Philip Guo.

Google Calendar API framework based on [this basic Google Calendar API skeleton](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/986631/Google-Calendar-API-with-JavaScript) by Schatak and [the Google Calendar API implementation page for CS 249 at Wellesley College](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~mashups/pages/am4calendar.html).

Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Datepair by Jon Thornton](http://jonthornton.github.io/Datepair.js/)
